Mookie Betts,042222js114.jpg,No,"**Assessment of Image Quality**

The provided image does not meet the strict requirements for a suitable facial image for AI training.

**Reasons for Rejection**

* **Inadequate Lighting**: The lighting on the face is poor, with heavy shadows and no clear source of illumination.
* **Blurry Resolution**: The resolution of the image is too low to clearly distinguish facial features.
* **Profile View**: The subject's profile is visible, rather than a frontal view.

**Quality Score**

Due to these significant issues, I must reject this image as unsuitable for training purposes. A quality score of 2 reflects the poor lighting and blurry resolution, which are critical factors in determining an image's suitability for AI training.
